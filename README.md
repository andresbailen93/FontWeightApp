# FontWightApp

This is an example App to show how to work with font weight, instead of android textStyle:

````
<TextView
android:textStyle="bold|italic|normal"
...
````

In this case, our goal is to use the device's default font, but with more advanced customization than `textStyle`.

 ## Why?

We can use a custom font instead of system font. But sometimes we want the user to find a typography in which they feel comfortable.
